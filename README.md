# Customer info forms - Gather customer info

![screenshot](src/images/screenshot.png)

## Description

I started this project after a request from my current job. They needed to gather customer information and input this in their system. They previously used a paper and pen method and did the inserting manually into the system. With this form website the customer can enter their details on a pad and the answer will appear on another device (PC, phone etc). The information can than easily be copy / pasted with a one click copy solution. The form inputs can be controlled, the language of the form can be switched and the answers can show in both uppercase or lowercase letters. Feel free to try out on the test user provided below.
